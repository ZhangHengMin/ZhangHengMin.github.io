- **Learning with Structured Sparseness and Low-rankness**:  Due to special structures of various data, it can be potentially to take advantage these merits for characting residual function and regularized term. Using these property is necessary to remove redundancy and maintain principal information followed by mining other noval concepts. Giving the explainable structures for exact learning, it
will be very useful for task-originated applications.


- **Higher Computational Efficacy and Efficiency**: To address large-scale optimization problems, it can be very expensive when we aim to get the desired solvers, which involve the performed evaluation and the timing consumptions. However, nonconvex problems often perform well but are challenge for convergence analysis compared with convex ones. acquire the complete data. Hence, under these considerations, it becomes very necessary and reliabe for designing efficient numerical approach by reducing the number of iterations and the computational complexity.

- **Combination of Machine Learning and Automatic Control**: To effectively leverage long-range and multi-scale past information, a unified temporal memory relation network is introduced to achieve it. All the preceding features are considered with the current time step, hence, the current feature can be augmented. Also, the linear operation avoids too heavy regularization with similarity matrix directly performed on the input signal. It seems take the inspiration of <a href=" http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/dauphin17a"> GLU </a> in this module which is good at long-term modeling.
