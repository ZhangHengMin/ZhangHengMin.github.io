- **Learning with Structured Sparseness and Low-rankness**:  Due to special structures of various data, it can be potentially to take advantage these merits for characting residual function and regularized term. Using these property is necessary to remove redundancy and maintain principal information followed by mining other noval concepts. Giving the explainable structures for exact learning, it
will be very useful for task-originated applications, e.g., image classification/inpainting, subspace clustering.


- **Reaching Higher Computational Efficacy and Efficiency**: To address large-scale optimization problems, it can be very expensive when we aim to get the desired solvers, which involve the performed evaluation and the timing consumptions. However, nonconvex problems often perform well but they are very challengable for the theoretical convergence analysis when compared with convex ones. Hence, under these considerations, it becomes very necessary and reliabe for designing efficient numerical approachs by reducing the number of iterations and the computational complexity.

- **Combination of Machine Learning and intelligent Control**: Finding common problems in both machine learning and automatic control, it is very interestiong to develop noval methods for the resulting solutions. By the feasiable machine learning techniques characterized for better understanding and decision-making of intelligent learning, it is very important to provide the further fundemental researches in the areas of optimization algorithm, machine learning and intelligent control, etc.
